# 🎤 ChaosVerse
Where karaoke meets complete nonsense!

ChaosVerse is a browser-based anti-karaoke experience built for pure fun, randomness, and chaos. It plays a karaoke track, displays completely unrelated and ridiculous lyrics.

## 🌌 What Is This?

ChaosVerse takes a regular karaoke experience and turns it into absolute nonsense:

- Plays songs
- Displays fake subtitles based on chaotic modes
- Absolutely no purpose. Just joy.
