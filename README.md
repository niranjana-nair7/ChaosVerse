Where karaoke meets complete nonsense!

ChaosVerse is a browser-based anti-karaoke experience built for pure fun, randomness, and chaos. It plays a karaoke track, displays completely unrelated and ridiculous lyrics.

## 🌌 What Is This?

ChaosVerse takes a regular karaoke experience and turns it into absolute nonsense:

- Plays songs
- Displays fake subtitles based on chaotic modes
- Absolutely no purpose. Just joy.

## 🌀 Chaos Modes

Pick from multiple lyric styles, all synced to the beat, none synced to reality:

- 🎭 `bad-translation.json` – Google Translate meets poetry
- 🧙‍♂️ `shakespeare.json` – “Oh fair thou doth vibe”
- 🧠 `ai-hallucination.json` – Text generated from a fever dream
- ⚖️ `the-judge.json` – Courtroom drama energy
- 💼 `corporate.json` – Q4 synergy reports disguised as love songs. 
- 🧚 `disney-fanfic.json` – Magic, cringe, and mice
- 🐍 `python-coder.json` – Written by someone who hasn’t seen daylight since the last pip install.
- 🐸 `yoda-mode.json` – Backwards everything is. Confused you will be. Laugh, you must.
- 📱 `gen-z.json` – ✨fr this hits different ngl✨
